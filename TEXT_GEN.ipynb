        "#### Importance and Applications of Text Generation\n",
        "Text generation has a wide array of applications ranging from chatbots and virtual assistants to content creation and summarization tools. It plays a critical role in automating and enhancing various aspects of information technology, customer service, and content management. The ability to generate coherent, contextually relevant, and nuanced text is crucial in many domains, including journalism, creative writing, and automated report generation.\n",

        "This notebook aims to provide a comprehensive guide to text generation using transformer models, with a focus on different decoding methods. We'll explore several methods -\n",

        "- Beam Search,\n",
